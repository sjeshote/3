    <h1>Welcome y'all</h1>
    <h2>How I might actually pass this test</h2>
    <p>I am willing to work very hard for the next <strong>four days</strong>, since my test is on the 
        <strong>23rd</strong> of this month, which falls on Monday. This Satuday, I am 
        invited to a baptism and I plan to study in the train. 
        I want to get the <strong>tags, and loops down</strong>. I am confident when it comes
        to HTML and CSS, however <strong>JavaScript scares me</strong>. That's because I am forced
        to do <strong>some mathematical shit, which I suck at and it is a miracle I was capable
        to waltz through life with minimal understading</strong>. Not only that, I freaking decided to take 
        Computer Science in <a href="https://www.unil.ch/index.html">UNIVERSITY!</a> Who does that, you might ask... 
        MOI, <strong>Mademoiselle Senait Jesho Teklesyesus, her Highness, that's who!
        Man! I feel like a stupid woman! Sorry <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shania_Twain">Ms Twain!</a></strong>

        Here is a very necessary picture of Ida B.Wells to do so.
